Sample Rails 2.3 apps showing usage of Paperclip + S3 on Heroku.

===

A few things to notice:

* Pay special attention when copying code from tutorials. Some text converting filters like Textile and SmartyPants will convert "100x100" to "100Ã—100" (notice how the "x" character was converted to ASCII 215, which will be passed to ImageMagick and cause a failure).

* Paperclip by default swallows STDERR when calling ImageMagick, making it hard to debug problems with its binaries. To avoid this behavior you might want to disable it with:

  Paperclip.options[:swallow_stderr] = false
